# Description
This is a simple web-based quiz application that tests the user's knowledge of programming concepts. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions and is timed, with a penalty for incorrect answers. The user can save their initials and score at the end of the game.

The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily customized with additional questions or different styling.

# Installation
To use the application, simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file. Then, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

# Usage
Once the application is running in your browser, click the "Start Quiz" button to begin. The timer will start, and the first question will be displayed. Select one of the available answers by clicking on the corresponding button.

If you answer correctly, the next question will be displayed. If you answer incorrectly, time will be deducted from the clock, and the next question will still be displayed. Once all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero, the game will end.

At the end of the game, you will be asked to enter your initials to save your score. Your score is based on the number of questions you answered correctly and the time remaining on the clock.
